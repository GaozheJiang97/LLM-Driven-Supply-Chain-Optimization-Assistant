\section{Problem Statement}
Efficient supply chain management is a critical driver for operational success in modern businesses. Even minor inefficiencies in planning, resource allocation, and logistics can lead to significant cost overruns, delivery delays, and overall operational disruptions. Many companies struggle to formulate and solve the complex optimization problems required to streamline these processes, especially when decision-makers lack deep expertise in operations research (OR).

\textbf{The Challenge:}  
Develop an intelligent system that allows users to describe their supply chain problems in plain, natural language. The system automatically extracts key parameters and formulates a corresponding optimization model to compute an optimal shipment plan. By bridging the gap between natural language and mathematical optimization, the system aims to democratize advanced analytical methods.

\textbf{Importance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} Enables business managers and analysts to leverage advanced OR without needing extensive technical training.
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Automates the translation from natural language descriptions to mathematical models, saving time and reducing errors.
    \item \textbf{Cost Savings:} Optimizes resource allocation to minimize shipping and transportation costs.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Establishes a scalable foundation for tackling more complex supply chain challenges in the future.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution Approach}
Our solution integrates modern Large Language Model (LLM) techniques with classical optimization methods using a modular, agent-based architecture.

\subsection*{Key Components:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Parsing with LLMs:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We simulate an LLM parser that converts natural language descriptions into structured data by extracting key parameters such as warehouse names, store names, available supply, demand requirements, and shipping costs.
        \item \emph{Future Enhancement:} Upgrade this module using frameworks like \texttt{LangChain} or \texttt{DSPy} and live API calls (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4) to dynamically process user inputs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimization Module:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The extracted parameters are used to formulate a transportation problem as a linear programming (LP) model.
        \item We utilize \texttt{PuLP}, a Python library for LP, to construct and solve the optimization model. The objective is to minimize the total shipping cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interactive Web Interface:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \texttt{Streamlit} web application serves as the user interface, allowing users to input a natural language description of their supply chain problem and view the parsed parameters and optimization results in a clear, interactive format.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
